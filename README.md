I wanted to practice API building using Java, Spring Boot and Docker, so I searched for "Java api challenge" on Google and this challenge was brought to me. Read the [instructions](./challenge-specs.md), the challenge seemed good enough since it would allow me to practice clean code; SOLID principles as well as the use of design patterns.

A Trello card, in the board I created to record every project I develop to practice, was created, so I'd be able to use the kanban system to track the development. Since it is a personal project, with no obligations to deliver to a client or anyone else, I felt like I could go on my own pace and get as deep as I wanted in every tool.

This project helped me better understand the use of DTOs (incoming and outgoing); of mappers (MapStruct was used, but now I can build my own); of the JpaInterface (which let me create functions by only defining their names); the breaking of functions and so on.

Even though I tried to write the best code I could, I'm not fully satisfied with it. I'll finish this project and re-try it with a predefined architecture, because I learned how hard it can be to make big changes in the code if the architecture was not well thought. Maybe I'll use the next shot to use a microservice architecture applied using the concept of [Evolutionary Architecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6hbKLQo0PUM).
